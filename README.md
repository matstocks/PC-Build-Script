# PC Build Script
 
Recommended install process;

- Run a clean installation of Windows. When we receive new laptops we will always wipe the device and do a fresh install.
- Once loading the desktop for the first time, the first and only thing we do is disable UAC. 
- Copy RunMe.bat and download.ps1 to a USB and run the RunMe.bat file. 
- The .bat will run the download.ps1 file which downloads the latest version of the PC setup script on GitHub.
